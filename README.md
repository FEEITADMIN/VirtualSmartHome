# Virtual Smart Home



This is a modification of a simple application create for my students on an IoT module at Northumbria University.

The purpose of this application is to demonstrate MQTT brokers and the pub/sub approach for IoT data transmission.

I created a separate project as HIVEMQ (The MQTT broker used on previous project did not have SSL so did not work on GitHub pages)

## Usage



To use this application head to [https://gcoulby.github.io/VirtualSmartHome/](https://gcoulby.github.io/VirtualSmartHome/)

Click Connect to connect to the public broker [https://www.emqx.io/](https://www.emqx.io/)

Lights can be turned off by publishing ("0" or "1") messages to the broker using the following variables.

```js
let host = broker.emqx.io
let port = 8084
let subject = "VirtualSmartHome/"
let topic = "Bedroom/Light"
```



Alternatively you can go to [https://gcoulby.github.io/VirtualSmartHomeController/](https://gcoulby.github.io/VirtualSmartHomeController/)

This is a very simple application with toggle controls for turning the lights on and off:
